        "review": "In all honesty, could I say the writing in this book is the best I've ever read? No definitely not but, the reason I gave this book five stars is that it really opened my mind up to some things I've never thought about. I finished this book in about four hours and was filled with happiness and sadness.",

If you are looking for a book with passion, excitement, sadness, anger, disappointment, lots of love and suspense this is the book to read! I could not contain myself the whole time of reading itâ€¦ absolutely breathtaking! The ending actually brought me to tears, my new all time favourite book. Anyone to ask me for a recommendation this will be the first.",

It is imperative to do so as it reminded us that heavy undone decisions could only be understood by the person in situation; and that heavy undone decisions aren't applicable and easy as it sounds to some affairs.",
